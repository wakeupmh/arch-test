# Request for Comments: Proposal for a Serverless Approach to Improve Cost Efficiency and Scalability

## Introduction
This RFC proposes adopting a serverless architecture as an alternative to the current Kubernetes-based infrastructure. The goal is to reduce operational complexity, lower costs, and enhance scalability by leveraging managed services and pay-as-you-go compute resources.

## Problem Statement
The current system relies on managed Kubernetes nodes, which incur significant compute costs ($150-$400/month). The architecture also includes PostgreSQL ($200-$500/month) and Redis ($50-$150/month), leading to an estimated monthly total of $400-$1050. Moreover, maintaining Kubernetes-based workloads demands operational expertise and can introduce latency during scaling events.

A serverless approach can:
- Eliminate the need for node management
- Reduce idle resource costs
- Enable automatic scaling for sporadic or unpredictable workloads

## Proposed Solution
Replace the Kubernetes-based solution with serverless services that align with the core functions of the existing architecture.

### Core Components and Migration Plan

#### Compute Layer
**Replace**: Kubernetes nodes with AWS Lambda or Azure Functions.
- *Advantages*:
  - Pay-per-use billing model reduces costs for sporadic workloads.
  - Auto-scaling is handled natively by the platform.
  - Simplified deployment pipelines.

#### API Gateway
**Replace**: Existing API Gateway with AWS API Gateway or Azure API Management.
- *Advantages*:
  - Built-in rate limiting, input validation, and request logging.
  - No operational overhead.
  - Seamless integration with Lambda Functions.

#### Database Layer
**Retain**: PostgreSQL
**Enhance**:
- Use AWS Aurora Serverless v2 or Azure SQL Database Serverless.
  - *Advantages*: Autoscaling database capacity based on demand.
  - Potential cost reduction during low-traffic periods.

#### Caching Layer
**Replace**: Redis with Amazon ElastiCache (serverless Redis).
- *Advantages*:
  - Fully managed service with no node management.
  - Similar performance capabilities.

### Architectural Adjustments

#### Presentation Layer
- API Gateway handles routing, input validation, and rate limiting.
- Lambda functions execute lightweight business logic.

#### Service Layer
- Encapsulate domain-specific logic into individual Lambda functions.
- Use AWS Step Functions for orchestrating complex workflows.

#### Data Persistence Layer
- Optimize database interactions with Aurora Serverless v2.
- Introduce DynamoDB for specific high-velocity, low-complexity data needs.

### Security Enhancements
- Leverage IAM roles and policies for fine-grained permissions.
- Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) for API Gateway.
- Maintain JWT-based authentication and HTTPS/TLS enforcement.

### Performance Optimizations
- Use provisioned concurrency for critical Lambda functions to reduce cold starts.
- Leverage caching with ElastiCache for high-read workloads.
- Asynchronous processing using SQS to decouple components.

## Cost Comparison
### Estimated Serverless Costs
1. **Compute (Lambda)**:
   - $100-$200/month (based on average invocation and execution time).
2. **Database (Aurora Serverless v2)**:
   - $100-$300/month (variable capacity scaling).
3. **Caching (ElastiCache)**:
   - $40-$120/month.

#### Total Estimated Cost: $240-$620/month
- Reduction of 30%-50% compared to Kubernetes-based costs.

## Trade-offs
### Advantages
1. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - No cost for idle compute resources.
2. **Operational Simplicity**:
   - Fully managed services eliminate node and cluster maintenance.
3. **Scalability**:
   - Native autoscaling capabilities reduce latency and improve performance under high traffic.

### Challenges
1. **Cold Starts**:
   - Mitigated with provisioned concurrency.
2. **Service Limits**:
   - Requires monitoring and increasing quotas for AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
3. **Vendor Lock-in**:
   - Transitioning to serverless services increases reliance on a single cloud provider.

## Conclusion
A serverless approach offers substantial benefits in cost savings and scalability while simplifying operations. By replacing Kubernetes with serverless alternatives, the architecture can achieve better alignment with unpredictable workloads and reduce monthly infrastructure costs. This RFC recommends piloting the serverless architecture for non-critical workloads to validate performance and cost assumptions before a full migration.

## Next Steps
1. Conduct a cost analysis with current traffic patterns.
2. Develop a proof of concept (PoC) for migrating one workload to serverless.
3. Evaluate performance metrics and cost savings.
4. Refine the plan for full migration based on PoC results.

### Feedback Request
- Are there specific workloads or bottlenecks in the current system that may pose challenges to serverless migration?
- Should any additional services be evaluated for compatibility with the proposed architecture?
